Hello,

I am still in the process of learning Git, so this page may be very messy with repositories being added/removed from time to time while I get the hang of this.<br/>
Nevertheless, welcome to my page, I hope by the time you read this, there is stuff here that will be useful for somebody, rather than just junk!<br/>

More about me: I know Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript to a limited extent, and I write synopses for anime on MyAnimeList.<br/>
I'm still a college student, attempting an Associate's in Computer Programming.<br/>
Hopefully, I will begin to grasp programming better in the future.<br/>

I don't know necessarily what I want to specialize in just yet. There are just too many options!<br/>
Whoever you are, the one reading this, I look forward to collaborating!<br/>
